# These functions are used in the final step of a PSA which was done
# with multiple reps for multiple samples.

# It might be slightly overkill but it allowed me to get some more
# practice with a couple advanced **purrr** maneuvers. The modify_if concept
# is awesome.

# In these functions I am basically doing the same transformation on three
# data frames, but because the cumulative % passing is in long format,
# it has to first be transformed to wide format so that I can use across to
# summarize all the numeric columns. Then it has to be transformed back to long.
# format. If I didn't have to avoid summarizing the microns column this
# would be simpler, but I just decided to create two helpers that use predicates
# to only transform the list elements (i.e. data frames) that have a column
# named "microns", which in this case is obviously only one data frame.

# Then I can use a general function to perform the averaging for _all_ the
# data frames in the list before doing the reverse of the process described
# above. That leaves the original list in its same format, but less the
# columns for the batch sample number and replication, as these are inherently
# not part of a summarizing process over replicated samples.
