## Utility

**soiltestr** is built to help collect and analyze laboratory soil test data. I wrote the functions for my own use, but other soil scientists may find them of value. The code streamlines commonly performed tests: particle size analysis, Atterberg limits, Proctor maximum density, and particle density (specific gravity).

This package is currently under heavy development and likely will be rather opaque to new users. However, I plan to streamline the documentation and release it to CRAN.

## Installation

A binary version of `soiltestr` is not yet available on CRAN. Install the development version with the following command:

``` r
remotes::install_github("evanmascitti/soiltestr")
```

## Functions 

Below are one-line overviews of each function's purpose:

### Data analysis 

`add_w()`: Calculate gravimetric water content and add to an existing data frame

`add_physical_properties()` Compute various metrics from raw Proctor data

`proctor_prep()`: Specimen preparation for Proctor compaction tests

`proctor_fit()`: Fit a compaction curve to compute w<sub>opt</sub> and &rho;<sub>max</sub> 

`d_max()` Fit a compaction curve and compute the maximum density only.  

`w_opt()` Fit a compaction curve and compute the optimum water content only. 

[`compute_LL()`](R/compute_LL.R) calculate the liquid limit from water contents and blow counts

[`LL_batch_analysis()`](R/LL_batch_analysis.R) calculate liquid limit of all specimens tested in a batch

[`PL_batch_analysis()`](R/PL_batch_analysis.R) calculate plastic limit of all specimens tested in a batch

[`AL_batch_analysis()`](R/AL_batch_analysis.R) calculate adhesion limit of all specimens tested in a batch

[`pipette_analysis()`](R/pipette_analysis.R) analyze pipette and sieve data for one or more samples


### Visualization 

`ggproctor()` plotting compaction curves with **ggplot2**

`ggflowcurve()` plotting liquid limit data with **ggplot2**

`casagrande_chart()` display Atterberg limits on the traditional LL vs PI scatterplot, with U-line and A-line plotted

[`ggpsd()`](R/ggpsd.R) plot one or more particle size distributions

[`ggpsd_single_sample()`](ggpsd_single_sample.R.R) plot particle size distributions for a single specimen

[`ggphase_diagram()`](R/gg_phase_diargam.R) plot solid, liquid, and gaseous phases of a sand-clay mix


### Data managmement and reference sheets

`mix_calcs()`: Precise calculations for sand-clay soil mixtures

#### Populate skeleton .csv files for data collection (function names self-explanatory)

`generate_proctor_datasheet()` 

[`pipette_datasheets()`](R/pipette_datasheets.R) creates .csv data sheets for the different types of data required in this analysis

[`att_lims_datasheets()`](R/att_lims_datasheets.R) creates .csv data sheets for liquid, adhesion, and plastic limit tests
