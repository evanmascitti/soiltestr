\usage{
Gs_batch_analysis(file, pycnometer_bottles = NULL, tin_tares = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pycnometer_bottles}{a data frame of pycnometer bottle masses and volumes; if left as NULL, the option \code{soiltestr.pycnometer_bottles} is queried}

\item{tin_tares}{a data frame of tin tares; if left as NULL, the option \code{soiltestr.tin_tares} is queried}

\item{dir}{folder to look for data file}
}
\value{
a list of length 3: the results for each sample, a summary with the average for each sample (across replications), and a dotplot showing the spread of the results across replications. The column \code{Gs} is the specific gravity of the soil solids at 20 Â°C
