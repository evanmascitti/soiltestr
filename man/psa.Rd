\arguments{
\item{dir}{Folder containing the pertinent files}

\item{bouyoucos_cylinder_dims}{dimensions of sedimentation cylinders}

\item{tin_tares}{data frame of tin tares used for water content determination}

\item{beaker_tares}{data frame of beaker tares used for pipette methods}

\item{hydrometer_dims}{data frame of hydrometer dimensions}

\item{...}{other arguments passed for individual protocols. These identify sets of lab equipment used to perform calculations. See details.}
}
\value{
List of length 6 containing:
\enumerate{
\item Data frame of cumulative percent passing data (tidy/long format)
\item Data frame with breakdown into traditional SSSA size classes (wide format)
\item Data frame with breakdown into size sub classes, if measured
(wide format); if not possible due to limited number of particle diameters,
this element is \code{NULL}; various breakdowns are available based on the chosen
protocol (see \code{\link[=psa_protocols]{psa_protocols()}})
\item List of ggplot objects (one per specimen)
\item Metadata about the test protocol
\item If pre-treatment was performed, the loss on pre-treatment for each specimen;
otherwise \code{NULL}
}
}
\description{
Accepts a variety of laboratory protocols, see \code{\link[=psa_protocols]{psa_protocols()}}
}
\details{
This function relies on the dimensions of lab equipment used during the tests.
It is recommended to set these as global options at the top of your script or in an \verb{.Rprofile file}, but they can also be passed as individual named arguments. See the vignette on setting lab equipment to work with \strong{soiltestr}. (link needed).
Choices include the following (tests which require each type of equipment are in parentheses):
\itemize{
\item \code{bouyoucos_cylinder_dims} (hydrometer)
\item \code{tin_tares} (all tests)
\item \code{psa_beaker_tares} (pipette)
\item (need to finish this list before publishing on CRAN)....
}
