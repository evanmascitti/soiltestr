## code to prepare `psa_protocols_summary` dataset goes here


# This data object is built independently from the more verbose data object
# `psa_protocols`, but they have similar dependencies.....the former is designed
# for easy use with tab completion, while this one is meant for a quick lookup
# of the number.

# make a tibble containing the summaries of each protocol
# note that protocl_ID is a character type even though I am using numbers
# this is to allow the protocols to each be named list objects
# because object names cannot be numeric type.
