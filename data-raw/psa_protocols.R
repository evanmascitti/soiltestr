# lines joins with the references table to add a list-column and then reduce
# this column by a level to make it a character vector instead of a list then
# the variables are arranged to a more logical order
# Then, nest the pre-treatments into a list column.
# Finally, make it into a simple list rather than a tibble, set the names of
# each list element and and name the object for export

# process . Should I later wish to re-visit, the code to compile into a larger list with the summary is below:

#
# psa_protocols <- list(
#   summary = protocol_summaries,
#   details = protocols_list

# export list as a data object
